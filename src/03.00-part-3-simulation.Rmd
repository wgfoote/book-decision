# Part 3 -- Simulation {-}  

Getting our arms around  

- Developing a waiting time archetypal model to answer specific business questions

- Simulating correlated variates

- Applying variates to the waiting time model

- Collecting data relevant to the decision framework inherent to the simulation model

- Exploring simulated data

- Analyzing sensitivity of results with respect to changes in in key decision parameters
